## Description:

* This website is designed to help soccer/football fans to track the live scores/past scores and standing of teams of their favourite leagues.
* This project was completed based on the JavaScript Web API concepts, as well as utilizing third-party framework to efficiently perform the operations (Moment.js, Foundation).
* This project also links to the server-side apis from https://apifootball.com/ && http://worldtimeapi.org/ to extract up-to-date football games information and timezones of the world.
* We have learned the ways to fetch server-side apis in order to extract external databases && manipulated the styles/animations of the webpage to make it more interactive.
